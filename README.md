# MapReduce
Operating Systems exercise

In this project I've implemented an interface for the Map Reduce algorithm, using Kernel Level Threads (pthread library)
The user, using the MapReduceFramework interface, can use this library and set how many threads it wishes the program to work with.

The attached Makefile generates the libMapReduceFramework.a library when running 'make' with no arguments.

The user needs to implement MapReduceClient according to the given header and use the MapReduceFramework library.

Notes:
 MapReduceFramework.h and MapReduceClient.h was supplied and was not written by me.
